## Debugging Route Cache Issues 

If you suspect route cache staleness, there are a few ways to debug:

**Check the version number**

Pages include a version identifier that changes on redeploys. If the number is outdated, route cache is likely stale.

**Toggle caching rule**

Temporarily disable caching for the problem route via `dynamic` export or config. See if behavior fixes itself. 

**Inspect payload** 

Use React devtools to inspect if server components payload matches client. Mismatches indicate state desync.

**Conditional rendering**

Render an indicator based on request time vs build time to detect stale output.

**Monitor revalidations**

In Analytics, monitor number of revalidations triggered per route to optimize Cache-Control headers.

## Individual Route Configs

You can finely configure caching behavior on a per-route level:

```js
export const revalidate = 10 // Seconds 
export const runtime = 'nodejs' // Override environment 
export const allowMethods = ['GET'] // Allowed HTTP methods
```
Common use cases:
   - Allow caching for some routes and disable for others
   - Customize revalidation intervals per route
   - Restrict allowed HTTP methods
Per-route configs override app-level configs.

## Conclusion

Debugging and optimizing the Full Route Cache unlocks speed and scale. Configuring caching rules for specific routes also improves flexibility.

With these tips, you can maximize the performance of your Next.js data fetching!
