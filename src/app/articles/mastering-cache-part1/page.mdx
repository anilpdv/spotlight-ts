The Full Route Cache allows Next.js to cache entire page outputs at build time instead of rendering on each request. This results in faster page loads and reduced server load.

In this guide, we'll cover how route caching works, how to implement it, common caching issues, and best practices for optimizing performance.

## How Route Caching Works

Next.js renders routes in React on the server. The rendered output is split into two parts:

1. **React Server Component Payload**: A binary representation of the rendered React components.
2. **HTML**: Generated HTML markup from the React components. 

For static routes, Next.js persists both parts in the Full Route Cache during build and revalidation.

On the client, the cache is rehydrated for instant interactivity.

## Implementing Route Caching

By default, static routes are eligible for automatic caching at build time.

To cache a dynamic route, there are two options:

1. **Hybrid**: The route itself remains dynamic, but its data can be cached.
2. **Full Static Generation**: Statically generate the route's HTML + payload by specifying static paths.

## Common Caching Issues

There are a few common caching pitfalls to be aware of:

- **State mismatch**: Client state doesn't match server state due to outdated cache. Use revalidation to keep cache in sync.
- **Memory limits**: Route cache consumes too much memory. Use dynamic rendering or disable caching per-route.  
- **Slow revalidation**: Background revalidation hurts time to first byte. Use incremental static regeneration.

## Optimizing Cache Invalidation 

There are a few best practices that can help:

- Revalidate data frequently enough to stay fast, but not too frequently to avoid waste.
- Use granular revalidation over global revalidation.
- Disable caching for rarely visited routes.
- Monitor cache efficiency in analytics.

## Conclusion

Route-level caching unlocks speed and scale in Next.js. Understanding how caching works and optimizing cache invalidation are key to building high-performance applications.

This covers the basics - now go forth and cache those routes!
